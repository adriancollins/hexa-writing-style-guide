## UI Guidelines
Follow these guidelines when creating UI terms in addition to the rest of the Writing Style Guide.
Use the [Material Design guide](https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html) and the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/terminology/) for additional support.

### Eliminate redundancy
Wherever possible remove words that don't add any extra information to your message.

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| Create New File | Create File |
| In order to | To              |


### Be active
When you want a user to do something, make sure your user knows it. Use a call to action where appropriate.

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| New Users | Add new users |


### Be positive
Use positive language. Tell your user what they can do instead of what they can't do.

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| You cannot upload Rich Text files | You can upload Word and PDF files only |


### Be consistent
Using consistent language will help your user better understand the meaning.

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| To log into the server click "Sign in" | To log into the server click "Log in"|


### Avoid "the user"
Using the term user is depersonalising. Try to write directly to your user to make them feel more engaged with your message. Where appropriate use "you".

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| The user should click "Save" to save the changes | Click "Save" to save the changes |


### Use "I"
Use ‘I’ where your user wants to tell the system what to do. This gives your user a feeling of personal interaction with the system.

| By signing up, You accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy | By signing up, I accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy |


### Be user oriented
Think about how your communication will be used and make life easier for your audience. For example, if you're communicating a long password, consider making it easy to copy and paste. Make your content searchable. Make complex content as simple as possible with formatting choices.

### Don't over communicate
Use simple language to convey your message and only communicate what your user needs to know to complete their task.

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| The email you entered does not match the required format. Please enter your email using the standard format. | Please enter your email address in the format *yourname@example.com*.|


### Use short words
Short and plain words are easy to scan and quick to understand.

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Are you sure you want to delete this photo? | Delete photo? |



### Connect similar words
Use similar words where applicable so that your user can connect them easily. Buttons are never "Yes" or 'No".

| Do not write: ![do not write](img/Symbol_thumbs_down.svg)  | Replace with: ![replace with](img/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg)|
| ------------- |-------------|
| Save Document?  | Save Document? |
| Yes / No        | Save / Cancel  |

### Give some context
Don’t assume people remember their last action.

| ------------- |-------------|
| Delete this? |  Delete “This week” group?|


### Use numerals
Don't use the textual form of numbers.
