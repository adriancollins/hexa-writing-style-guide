# Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to document how you should contribute to this project.


# Issues
Log any issues you have seen in the project [Issues] https://github.com/mckesson/writing-style-guide/issues.
Good issues include spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and formatting errors. In the issue, explain what the error is and where the error is in the code. If possible and appropriate, suggest a correction.
Use issues to also identify new features or omitted content you think should be include. Be as explicit as possible, again, identifying examples where appropriate.

If you want to correct an issue, assign it to yourself.
