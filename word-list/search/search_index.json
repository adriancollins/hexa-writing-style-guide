Create it in the top level directory of your project. Goal The goal of your CONTRIBUTING file is to help contributors submit well formed pull requests and to open useful issues. Learn more at setting guidelines for repository contributors . It supports the contributor on the following tasks. Environment details: How to set up your development environment. We recommend including this in the README so provide a link to the file here. How to submit changes: Provide Pull Request protocol, include expected norms on response for the code owners on submission. How to report a bug: Detail how an issue should be created by filling out the bug report issue and include what information is expected. How to raise a new feature request: Detail how an issue should be created by filling out the feature request issue and include what information is expected. CONTRIBUTING template Use this as a sample guide for your CONTRIBUTING file. Change as you need. :tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute. :tada: ### Purpose Use this document to learn how to contribute to `repo name`. ### Project Documentation The `README` in the root of the repository should link to project documentation. If you can't find the documentation you're looking for, please file a `GitHub issue` with details of what you would like to see documented. ### I don't want to read the whole thing,I just have a question! We use our `GitHub team` discussions to give helpful answers on any questions about this project. Please don't add an issue to ask a question. ### What should I know before I get started For details on prerequisites and how to get started on with this project please go to the `README` file ### Bug report Bugs are tracked as Github issues using the `bug template issue`. Use this template to create a bug report, include as many details as possible as the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster. Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. ### Feature requests Feature requests or suggested enhancements are tracked as GitHub issues using `feature request issue`. Use this template to capture the following information. - Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the request. - Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement with as much details as possible. - Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. - Explain why this enhancement would be useful. ### First code contribution A good place to start when considering how to contribute to this project is to review the issues labelled `good first issue` and `help-wanted`. As a first time contributor choose `good first issue` as this should require limited code changes. For a more in-depth contribution select a `help-wanted` issue. ### Pull requests Please adhere to the following steps to open a pull request for your proposed changes. *Note that examples of how to contribute to a project are using the command line interface. There is also the option of using GitHub Desktop to manage your work, learn more [here](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects).* - Clone the repo. If you cloned the repo a while ago, get the latest changes from master. *For example:* ``` bash $ git clone git@github.com/adriancollins/hexa-writing-style-guide ``` Or, update you local copy ``` bash $ git pull origin master ``` - Create a new branch to contain your feature, change, or fix. Branch name should be short and reflect the work you are doing. *For example:* ``` bash $ cd writing-style-guide $ git checkout -b my-code-changes ``` - Make changes, including necessary changes to READme.md and test locally - Commit your changes. *For example:* ``` bash $ git add README.md $ git commit $ git push origin my-code-changes ``` - Push changes to GitHub. - Create a pull request, providing a title and details on the changes you have made. Link to an issue by adding # issue no. - Two developers must approve your pull request before you can merge it to master. Expect review responses within 24hrs. - Merge the pull request on approval. Consider squashing all commits for this pull request squash to retain a clean and readable git history. - Choose to close the pull request without merging if the change is not longer required.

Consider the points below when writing for both global and local audiences. Following these points will help you communicate clearly. Write with an active voice . Write in the present tense . Use short sentences. Use plain language. Avoid jargon. Tone of voice Writing with a tone of voice defines how we sound to our readers. In summary, your writing tone should be the following: Clear Confident Caring For more detailed examples of Hexa tone please refer to Hexa Brand Central . Tense Above all, be consistent. Jumping between tenses will confuse your reader. Where possible and appropriate, write in the present tense. The future tense suggests some uncertainty. In particular, avoid the verbs will and have. Do not write: Replace with: When you press the button the application will send a request to the server. Press the button. The application sends a request to the server. Active voice Where possible, write with an active voice. Sentences written in active voice increase clarity and ease translation efforts. When Active Voice is used, the subject acts. The verb action of the sentence creates Active Voice. Some languages use passive voice rarely, if at all, so the translation can end up sounding stilted or unnatural. Active and passive voice examples are presented below. reference here . Passive Voice: Active Voice The technical blog post was written by Daphne. Daphne wrote the technical blog post. A new programming language was included in the web application. The web application includes a new programming language. A better user experience was ensured by incorporating accessibility during the design process. Incorporating accessibility during the design process ensures a better experience for users. Testing your writing for active voice To test your writing for active voice append the words \"by zombies\" to the end of your sentence. If the sentence still makes sense, then you have a passive voice. Start with a objective When a phrase describes a goal and the action needed to achieve it, start the sentence with the goal. Do not write: Replace with: Drag a photo to the trash to remove it from this album To remove a photo from this album, drag it to the trash Anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism means to give human attributes to an inanimate object. Avoid attributing human characteristics to devices and software. Common words that indicate human characteristics and actions include behaves, refuses, wants, thinks, knows, realizes, likes, allows, lets, expects, offers, permits, and enables. Do not write: Replace with: The Portal Settings pane lets you configure the Application Portal for your users. Use the Portal Settings pane to configure the Application Portal for your users. May / Can When you see can in your document, consider deleting it. Can implies ability but not action. Rewrite to describe the action if possible. Don't use may. It might be interpreted as providing persmission. Punctuation Oxford comma Use the Oxford comma in your text. The Oxford comma is a comma immediately preceding the conjunction (\u201cand\u201d or \u201cor\u201d) in a list of items. It\u2019s used to separate items in a list in order to avoid misunderstanding. Do not write: Replace with: Red, green, yellow, purple and black are examples of colors. Red, green, yellow, purple, and black are examples of colors. Semicolon Avoid using semicolons in your writing. They usually indicate overly long sentences. Instead, split your sentence into shorter sentences. Ellipses In general, don\u2019t use an ellipsis (\u2026). Dates Use this format for dates: month day, year. For example, July 31, 2016. In UI, if space is an issue, use the following month abbreviations: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Always use two digits for the day element. Capitalize the names of months and their abbreviations. Don't include a period with the abbreviations. Don't use ordinal numbers (such as 1st, 12th, or 23rd) to indicate a date. Lists Use lists to structure related information. Each list entry should contain only a single item, action, or concept. Use a bulleted list for unordered information. For example, things that have something in common but don\u2019t need to appear in a particular order. Use a numbered list for sequential items or prioritized items. List introductory text Explain the purpose of your list with some introductory text. Use complete sentences. Do not use incomplete sentences with a colon as this style can be difficult to translate. Do not write: Replace with: To sign in to the database: 1. Click Login. 2. Enter your username and password. To sign in to the database, complete the following steps. 1. Click Login. 2. Enter your username and password. List capitalization Begin each item in a list with a capital letter unless there's a reason not to. List punctuation In bulleted and numbered lists, end each list item with a period if any item forms a complete sentence. Otherwise, do not include a period. Do not write: Replace with: 1. Click Login 2. Enter your username and password 1. Click Login. 2. Enter your username and password. 1. Eggs. 2. Milk. 3. Flour. 4. Add the eggs and milk to the flour 1. Eggs 2. Milk 3. Flour 4. Add the eggs and milk to the flour. Don\u2019t use semicolons, commas, or conjunctions (such as and/or) at the end of list items. \u02dc Gerunds A gerund (pronounced JER-und) is an English noun formed from a verb by adding -ing. Traditionally, these are used in titles and headings. Research has shown that gerunds make it more difficult to find content using search. Avoid using gerunds in titles and headings. Do not write: Replace with: Getting started Get started Setting up the router Set up the router Creating a template Create a template Abbreviations and acronyms Use abbreviations and acronyms sparingly. If a term is not used frequently, spell it out. On first use, include the acronym in parentheses following the spelled-out term. On subsequent mentions in the same article, page, or screen, use the acronym without spelling it out. Avoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading. If the first use of the acronym is in a title or heading, introduce the acronym (in parentheses, following the spelled-out term) in the following body text. Don't spell out common acronyms like USB, FAQ, and URL.

Introduction to SSO Single sign-on (SSO) is a property of access control. Idioms and colloquialisms An idiom is a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words (for example, over the moon, see the light). Colloquialism is the use of informal words and phrases (for example, bamboozle). Eliminate idioms and colloquialisms from your technical communications. They can be confusing for non-native English speakers and hard to localize. Do not write: Replace with: get rid of discard, delete for good permanently figure out understand go ahead proceed, begin Link text Link text, also referred to as inline text or anchor text, is a link to another page embedded in a line of text. For example, \"The Hexa website has lots of useful links\". Make your link text useful. Use a phrase that describes what the reader will see after following the link. Create your link text to follow one of these formats: Use the exact title of the linked-to page, capitalized the same way the title is capitalized. Use a description of the linked-to page, capitalized like ordinary text instead of like a title. To improve scannability, keep link text short and concise.

Create it in the top level directory of your project. Goal The goal of your README file is to help your reader do 4 tasks. Identify your project. Evaluate your project. Understand how to use your project. Engage with your project. A README is not documentation. Keep it as short as possible. Try to treat it as an introduction to your project. 1. Identify your project Project name Give your project a simple name that describes it and distinguishes it from other projects. Additional information should be in your project's documentation. For example, hexa-hyperlink-checker 2. Evaluate your project Project description Tell your reader the goal of your project. Tell them what it can do and how it differs from similar projects For example, The hexa-hyperlink-checker is a command line tool that automatically checks hyperlinks in your markdown files. This is similar to other hyperlink validation tools but this tool also identifies shortened URLs that can be problematic in Hexa.' 3. Understand how to use you project Prerequisites List the tools, including software versions, and access rights your reader needs to have before they can use your project. Add available links to tools and include information about required service tickets. For example, * Git * Python 3.8.x Running the project Tell your reader how to run or use your project. Tell your reader what the expected outcome will be. This helps them to understand that it's working. A screenshot or animated GIF is useful here to orientate your reader. Where appropriate, consider adding some test files to your project where your reader can test their own installation. For example, Command $ python hexa-hyperlink-checker test_markdown.md Result $ line 43: bi.ty/34fdf7 shortened URLs are not allowed. 4. Engage with your project Add more information about your project here such as links to the project website and documentation, guidelines for contributing, and details for project support.
